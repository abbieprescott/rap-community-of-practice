# Useful links

This is a list, we have collated, of RAP resources throughout the Government and other areas. Let us know if you have any links to useful information, resources or guides that could be added to the list.

### Strategic

- The Government Analysis Function has published their [RAP strategy](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/policy-store/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-strategy/). It's very good for understanding what role we all have to play in RAP.
- The [Goldacre Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis) mentions RAP extensively as a key tool in improving the way we use patient data.
- [Here](https://www.bennett.ox.ac.uk/blog/2022/07/bennett-insights-an-overview-of-uk-data-policy-developments/) is a helpful summary of the above documents and others which helps understand RAP and why it is important in the context of UK data policy developments.

### Guidance and Standards

- The [AQUA book of analytical standards](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-aqua-book-guidance-on-producing-quality-analysis-for-government).
- The [ONS best practice team have a useful website - often called the Quack book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html) covering many of the same topics we cover here. Their [best-practice checklist](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/checklist_higher.html) is particularly useful.
- The Turing Institute has published [The Turing Way handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome.html)

### Examples, Challenges, Benefits

- Here is a good [high-level overview of RAP](https://dataingovernment.blog.gov.uk/2017/03/27/reproducible-analytical-pipeline/). It explains the context of RAP in government statistics and gives some history to the work.
- The GSS have produced a list of the [benefits that come from RAP](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/benefits-to-government-from-reproducible-analytical-pipelines/).
- The Statistics Authority has published this excellent report on [overcoming barriers to RAP adoption](https://osr.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/publication/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-overcoming-barriers-to-adoption/).
- Alston, J. M., and Rick, J. A.. 2020. A Beginner's Guide to Conducting Reproducible Research. Bull Ecol Soc Am 102(2):e01801. https://doi.org/10.1002/bes2.1801
- The GSS training portal offers an [Introduction to RAP course](https://gss.civilservice.gov.uk/training/introduction-to-reproducible-analytical-pipelines-rap/)
- The Government Analysis Function also did some [research on the rollout of RAP across different deparments](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/CARS-3/index.html).

### Community spaces

- There are several slack channels that discuss RAP and related topics: the [govdatascience.slack.com RAP channel](https://govdatascience.slack.com/archives/C6H22U3H9), the [NHS-R community](https://nhsrcommunity.slack.com/), and the [NHS-pycom community](https://nhs-pycom.slack.com/)
- We have an [MS Teams page](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3aEnoJ_c3NIwcWaLoqHyrbmiui8SI-8lZ1B2SvxNuGbyU1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=1c1528d7-030e-48eb-92cf-dc0f6a618ea0&tenantId=50f6071f-bbfe-401a-8803-673748e629e2) (internal to NHS Digital)
