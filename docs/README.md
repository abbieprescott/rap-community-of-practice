The RAP community of practice is intended for analysts and data scientists who are interested in adopting the working practices included in [reproducible analytical pipelines (RAP)][2]. It includes resources and guidance to help teams adopting RAP practices.

In a nutshell, RAP is becoming the standard for creating analytical outputs in government. RAP combines a number of ways of working that help to improve the reliability, transparency, and speed of statistics publications. Learn more on our [Why is RAP important][1] page.

**RAP in the NHS**

The [Goldacre Review](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/better-broader-safer-using-health-data-for-research-and-analysis), tasked with finding ways to deliver better, broader, and safer use of NHS data for analysis and research, identified RAP as the essential element to ensure high-quality analysis.
